LPmud version : FluffOS v2.27 on port 4242.
Welcome to Discworld: the stuff of which dreams are made.

Silently, slowly and surely, Great A'Tuin paddles through space, its
great eyes surveying the dark, empty wastes before and behind it.
Standing on A'Tuin's great back are four enormous elephants, straining
under the colossal weight of the Discworld itself.  It sparkles with
magic, reflects the light of the stars and generally fails to be as
unobtrusive as possible.

A large, floppy, black hat recedes into the distance, somehow looking
satisfied at what it has left behind.

Please imagine a very nice picture of four Elephants standing on the back of
a Turtle (sex unknown) swimming through space.  On the Elephants rests the
Disc of the world, garlanded by the long waterfall at its vast circumference
and domed by the baby blue vault of heaven.  Imagine this, because there is
not enough room here to draw it.
