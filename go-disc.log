LPmud version : FluffOS v2.27 on port 4242.
Welcome to Discworld: the stuff of which dreams are made.

Silently, slowly and surely, Great A'Tuin paddles through space, its
great eyes surveying the dark, empty wastes before and behind it.
Standing on A'Tuin's great back are four enormous elephants, straining
under the colossal weight of the Discworld itself.  It sparkles with
magic, reflects the light of the stars and generally fails to be as
unobtrusive as possible.

A large, floppy, black hat recedes into the distance, somehow looking
satisfied at what it has left behind.

Please imagine a very nice picture of four Elephants standing on the back of
a Turtle (sex unknown) swimming through space.  On the Elephants rests the
Disc of the world, garlanded by the long waterfall at its vast circumference
and domed by the baby blue vault of heaven.  Imagine this, because there is
not enough room here to draw it.

Queued command: look
The religious instructor asks: Lovely night isn't it, Brother Grelk?
     @+     This is a small, grim-looking room with rough walls of a dark grey
            stone.  The gilded velvet divan against the south wall seems
            strangely out of place, but at least it'll be warmer than the
            floor.  A small sign is attached to the wall above the divan and an
            iron door in the east wall leads out to the temple.
            There is one obvious exit: east.
            A religious instructor is standing here.
            A bulletin board [ 16 notes ] is mounted on one wall, a membership
            rota is nailed to the wall and a small sign is here.

Inventory regeneration complete.
(One) Aimi wisps: especially considering we dont neccessarily know the
     development timeline
(One) Aimi wisps: e.g. was it the same creator, was it in roughly the same era
     or did they change their mind later when making squirrels, etc
(One) Huupatux wisps: which makes it one of the dumbest things i've yet to
     discover about this game.
(One) Aimi wisps: everything seems worse when it affects you directly but
     honestly it really would not be that surprising or out of character for a
     game developed the way this is :)
The religious instructor falls flat on his face and spends some time talking to
the ground.
The religious instructor stands up.
The religious instructor brushes his clothes clean.
(One) Kaiju wisps: anyone up for a group?
(One) Aimi wisps: i find it a bit funny your idea of "one of the dumbest
     things" is "squirrels spawn during the day" :p
In the distance to the north, Old Tom, the tongueless and magical octiron bell
     of Unseen University, tolls four sonorous silences.
The religious instructor recites a prayer.
The religious instructor calls upon Sek for protection.
Nearby to the west, the big bronze gong in the Temple of Small Gods bongs four
     times.
